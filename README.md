## Picroft - 2018-09-11 Stretch Lightning release

Picroft is an enclosure for a Raspberry Pi 3 or 3B+ connected to a speaker and
microphone, bringing Mycroft to anyone who wants a simple voice interface they
have complete control over.  This is built on top of the officiall Raspbian Stretch
Lite image.

The entire project is available as a pre-built micro-SD image ready to be burned
and placed into a Raspberry Pi. You can download the pre-built image here:

SHA256 checksum: TODO

Optionally you can build it  yourself by following the [Recipe for building the image](image_recipe.md)

## Requirements

* **Raspberry Pi 3 or 3B+**
  <br>_Older Raspberry Pi versions do not have sufficient processing power, and if they work they will be very slow_
* **Speaker**
  <br>Any analog speaker, or an HDMI monitor with speaker
* **Microphone**
  <br>Tested with: PlayStation Eye, Blue Snowball, Google AIY
* **2.5 Amp or better power supply**
  <br>Don't skimp on this!  It might appear to work, but you'll have weird issues with a cheapo supply.
* **MicroSD Card**
  <br>8 GB or larger
* HDMI Monitor and keyboard, only required during setup


## Installation

1) Download and burn the image to the SD card.<br/>See the RaspberryPi.org's guide to [Installing Operating System Images](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) for detailed instructions on how to burn an image to your SD card.
2) Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi
3) Connect speaker, microphone, monitor and keyboard
4) Apply power
5) Follow the on-screen prompts to setup Picroft
6) Follow the verbal prompts to pair your device to an account at [Mycroft Home](http://home.mycroft.ai/#/device/add)
7) Talk to Mycroft and enjoy!

## Usage

Simply speak to Picroft as you would to any Mycroft.  For example:

    "Hey Mycroft, what time is it?"
    "Mycroft, how tall was Abraham Lincoln?"


## Older Versions
* [Raspbian Jessie version](https://github.com/MycroftAI/enclosure-picroft/tree/master)

## Help and more info
Check out the project wiki [here](https://github.com/MycroftAI/enclosure-picroft/wiki).  
There's also the general [Documentation](https://docs.mycroft.ai/).

## Customization
* `audio_setup.sh` configures your specific audio setup.
* `custom_setup.sh` is a stub meant to initialize anything before Mycroft starts.  For example, initializing connected devices, or launching services.

### FAQ
##### Q1) Why "Stretch Lightning"?
Because the image is built on Raspbian Stretch, and the lightning seen above was captured from the roof
to building the night I started this rework.

##### Q2) Can I run this with a the Raspbian desktop GUI?
Sadly, not really.  A Raspberry Pi is powerful, but still not well suited to do _everything_ at
once.  You can add other basic services on top of Picroft, but the desktop GUI requires too many
additional resources and neither Mycroft nor the GUI end up running well.
   
##### Q2) Can I run this with anything else?
Depends on what you want to add.  Serving simple webpages or polling devices periodically is probably
fine.  Mining bitcoin won't.
