## Picroft - Buster Keaton (Pork Pi) release

Picroft is an enclosure for a Raspberry Pi 3, 3B+ or 4 connected to a speaker and
microphone, bringing Mycroft to anyone who wants a simple voice interface they
have complete control over.  This is built on top of the official Raspbian
Buster Lite image.

The entire project is available as a pre-built micro-SD image ready to be
burned and placed into a Raspberry Pi. You can download the pre-built image
here:

Optionally you can build it yourself by following the [Recipe for building the image](image_recipe.md)

## Requirements

* **Raspberry Pi 3, 3B+, or 4**
  <br>_Older Raspberry Pi versions do not have sufficient processing power,
  and if they work they will be very slow_
* **Speaker**
  <br>Any analog speaker, or an HDMI monitor with speaker
* **Microphone**
  <br>A [list of Community tested hardware](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/using-mycroft-ai/get-mycroft/picroft#tested-hardware) is available in our documentation.
* **2.5 Amp or better power supply**
  <br>Don't skimp on this!  It might appear to work, but you'll have weird
  issues with a cheapo supply.
* **MicroSD Card**
  <br>8 GB or larger
* HDMI Monitor and keyboard, only required during setup


## Installation

1) Download and burn the image to the SD card.<br/>See the RaspberryPi.org's
   guide to
   [Installing Operating System Images](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)
   for detailed instructions on how to burn an image to your SD card.
2) Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi
3) Connect speaker, microphone, monitor and keyboard
4) Apply power
5) Follow the on-screen prompts to setup Picroft
6) Follow the verbal prompts to pair your device to an account at
   [Mycroft Home](https://account.mycroft.ai/devices/add)
7) Talk to Mycroft and enjoy!

## Usage

Simply speak to Picroft as you would to any Mycroft.  For example:

    "Hey Mycroft, what time is it?"
    "Mycroft, how tall was Abraham Lincoln?"


## Older Versions
* [Raspbian Jessie version](https://github.com/MycroftAI/enclosure-picroft/tree/master)

## Help and more info
To re-run the setup wizard, use `mycroft-setup-wizard`.
Check out the Picroft wiki [here](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/picroft/).
There's also the general [Documentation](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/).

## Customization
* `audio_setup.sh` configures your specific audio setup.
* `custom_setup.sh` is a stub meant to initialize anything before Mycroft
  starts.  For example, initializing connected devices, or launching services.

### FAQ
##### Q1) Why "Buster Keaton (Pork Pi)"?
This image is built on top of Raspbian "Buster" for running on a Raspberry Pi. 

[Buster Keaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Keaton) is best known 
for his silent films, but also his signature Pork Pie hats that he designed 
and made himself. Coincidentally, Buster Keaton's classic film
"[Safety Last!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-XZWZVVhvQ&ab_channel=moosetash)" 
came out of copyright in 2019.

The photo at the top of this page we thought was Buster Keaton wearing his 
signature hat. It turns out that it is actually a slightly more contemporary 
[Harold Lloyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Lloyd).

##### Q2) Can I run this with a the Raspbian desktop GUI?
Sadly, not really.  A Raspberry Pi is powerful, but still not well suited to do
_everything_ at once.  You can add other basic services on top of Picroft, but
the desktop GUI requires too many additional resources and neither Mycroft nor
the GUI end up running well.

##### Q3) Can I run this with anything else?
Depends on what you want to add.  Serving simple webpages or polling devices
periodically is probably fine.  Mining bitcoin won't.

##### Q4) Can I run this on a Pi4?
Yes!
